# Cherish

Cherish is a cloud platform for showing off your Initiatives to the world, and allowing the community to decide which ones they want to see come to fruition.

With Cherish you will be able to:

* Create Initiatives
* Vote and comment on Initiatives
* Set up goals
* Donate towards Initiatives
* Follow the activities from exisitng Initiatives

## Why Cherish?

There are a few options out there for hosting your goals and projects with community feedback and assistance... so why Cherish?

Cherish aims to set itself apart by enforcing a *good willed* policy on all of our Initiatives. That is, an Initiative must be within the following categories to be considered eligible for Cherish:

* Open Source Project
* Nonprofit
* Charity
* Event

## How It Works

*As a creator*

1. Create an account
2. Create your Initiative
3. Set up your goals
4. Advertise your Initiative and monitor your up votes/comments/donations through the Admin panel

*As a browser*

1. Create an account
2. Search for Initiatives by category or keyword
3. Vote and comment on the Initiatives you believe in
4. Donate towards Initiatives to help them achieve their goal
5. Share Initiatives on popular social media channels to help spread the word

## History and Development Process

Cherish is open source and developed with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). Cherish was started by [mariocatch](https://github.com/mariocatch) and [iamlasse](https://github.com/iamlasse). We started from Reddit with an eagerness to learn Meteor and give something back to the community.

### Project Roadmap

The Cherish roadmap is currently private, but we plan on making it public soon. We will take suggestions from the community on what features they would like to see implemented. We may open up a public slack channel as well.

### Contributing to Cherish

* Anyone is free to submit pull requests of their liking to Cherish through Github
